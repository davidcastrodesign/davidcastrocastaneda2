            <p>I was Born in Mexico and migrated to Ontario, CA at the age of five. During grade school, 
               I was the kid that spent his vacations and after school time in the Computer Lab playing games 
               and drawing pictures using Kid Pix. Throughout school most of my interests have been Art and 
               Video Games, though pre-college, had idea how to draw.

            <br>
               I received my Associate's from Riverside Community College where I spent most of my time studying
               illustration and towards the end started doing graphics and layout using Adobe. I then attended
               California State University of San Bernardino where I graduated with Bachlor's in Graphics and continued
               on to work in Los Angeles as in-house Graphic Designer.

            <br>
               Shortly after I moved to Beijing, where I focused along with my wife running an Enlgish Early Education Center.
               I used my artistic skills along with tricks I learned along the way to develop a curriculum and instruct
               children. Moving back to California, I knew I wanted to do Web and mobile design but also the coding. With the
               the advice of other Colleagues, I signed up for Coding Bootcamp and to become a software developer.
